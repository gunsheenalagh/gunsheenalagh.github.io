<h3><strong>How to help them in Unconsciousness</strong></h3>
<p align=Left><font size=4>Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If breathing or pulse stops at any time, roll the person onto their back and begin CPR. If you think there is a spinal injury, leave the person where you found them (as long as breathing continues).</p>
